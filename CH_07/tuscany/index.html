		<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
		<p>This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the

		<h2>Pozzarello</h2>

			stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year
			1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the
			adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside,
			despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our
			bedroom window.</p>

		<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>

			This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to
			Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna,
			and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by
			beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

		<h2>Sienna</h2>
		<p><a href="sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg"
									  alt="view from the bedroom window"
									  width="75" height="100"></a> The closest
			city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many
			days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local
			cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey
			Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

		<h2>Sweets</h2>
